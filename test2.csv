1, PIA, Ancillary Financial Application (AFA) system, https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/Ancillary_Financial_Applications_AFA_PIA.pdf, TIN, person’s name, SSN, home address, home phone, and e-mail address., These ancillary applications assist in GSA’s mission by allowing the Office of the Chief Financial Office users to review, validate, and reconcile transactions in a variety of financial domains such as vendor invoices and accounts payables., The Pegasys financial records are the system of record, but GSA currently maintains the AFA records indefinitely. At a minimum NARA requires retention for at least 6 years after contracts expire for financial management records., Data is shared between this system and Pegasys. It is a two-way interface, but personal data is only shared from Pegasys to AFA. AFA does not provide updates of the personal data back to Pegasys. Pegasys has moved to USDA and AFA shares data between the two systems., GSA/PPFM-11
2, PIA, Beta.SAM.gov, https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/BetaSAM%20PIA%20.pdf, In the Entity Management functional area, SAM contains records that capture information users voluntarily provide about their entity as part of the process to register to do business with the Federal Government, including the entity legal business name, entity email address, entity telephone number, entity Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and entity address. In the case of a sole proprietor, tax laws allow them to use their Social Security Number (SSN) as their TIN if they do not have a separate Employer Identification Number (EIN). The TIN (whether it be an EIN or an SSN) is not publicly available data. In the exclusion portion of the Performance Information functional area, SAM contains records entered by Federal agency suspension and debarment officials, some of which may be records on individuals., GSA has established a system of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended), 5 U.S.C. 552a. The System for Award Management (SAM) consolidates functions that were previously handled by the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system, Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)., System records are retained and disposed of according to GSA records maintenance and disposition schedules, the requirements of the Recovery Board, and the National Archives and Records Administration. For the Entity Management functional area, SAM allows users to update and delete their own entity registration records. For the exclusions portion of the Performance Information functional area, electronic records of past exclusions are maintained permanently in the archive list for historical reference. Federal agencies reporting exclusion information in SAM should follow their agency’s guidance and policies for disposition of paper records., Yes. Federal agency Contract Writing Systems (CWS), grants management systems, and financial systems will all use data from Beta.SAM. They go through a data access request process to allow them certain levels of data. The data is provided over encrypted connections and are either FTP or web services (XML). Part of the access process includes a Non-Disclosure Agreement and System Authorization Access Request which is agreed to by the requestor during the data access request process and includes user responsibility regarding the data., N/A
3, PIA, Carlson Wagonlit Government Travel, Inc., d.b.a. CWTSatoTravel, https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/E2-Solutions%20TAVS%20PIA%20webversion%20signed%20January%2011,%202018.pdf, To use E2 Solutions, a traveler must enter unique identifying information such as user id and password. A user profile is established for each traveler which contains personal information, including organization address, telephone number, travel preferences, frequent flyer and rental car club account numbers, passport information, emergency contract name, alternative address and telephone number, personal credit card number (official travel charge care account at a minimum), date of birth, gender, redress number, known traveler number, and other information as required by the agency’s Travel Authorization and Voucher System , Travel Management Center (TMC), and transportation providers for making reservations and issuing tickets. Information gathered includes Traveler Profile data, Name, SSN (if applicable by agency requirements), UserID, home address, home and office email, home and office telephone numbers, current passport and/or visa number(s), credit card numbers and related information; bank account information needed for electronic funds transfer; frequent traveler account information; travel claim information; destinations; date of birth; gender; redress number; known traveler number; and individual charges and balances. In addition, other passport information (i.e. issuing country, expiration date), and emergency contact information are included. Additional information may be entered at the traveler’s discretion for enhanced service, such as air, hotel, and car rental preferences, and frequent traveler or club membership numbers. When travel arrangements are made, the following information is entered: travel dates and times, departure and arrival cities and airports or terminals, selected airline flight or train tickets Privacy Impact Assessment CWTSatoTravel, E2 Solutions Page 6 Version 01/11//2018 reserved, hotel reservations, and car rentals reserved. Any special requests or accommodations required are also entered. Federal agency accounting systems will interface with the E2 Solutions component for proper recording of obligations when travel authorizations are approved, and for recording expenses when voucher payments are made. (Data will be passed between systems. The agency accounting systems will not have direct access to E2 Solutions databases.) The Travel Management Center (TMC) will have access to the profile and reservation data input by the traveler. This access is necessary for the TMC to complete reservation and ticketing actions (e.g. in order to email the traveler her itinerary). The TMC does not have access to E2 Solutions.. The on-line booking engine directs reservations to the TMC for fulfillment, i.e., ticketing for transportation and confirmation of hotel and/or car reservations. The reservation systems, or Global Distribution Systems (GDS), provide the link between the on-line booking engine and the TMC. GDSX, the interface between the GDS and E2 Solutions provides updates to the traveler’s reservations if modifications are made. This is an interface which data securely traverses between E2 Solutions and the GDS to maintain the integrity of the travelers’ reservations., Collection of PII is required for E2 Solutions application in support of the ETS2 master contract. The individual traveler’s profile data is needed to accurately reserve and ticket travel, and to have expenses charged to the proper travel charge card account. The reservation data is needed to accomplish the required travel, and to estimate trip costs for authorization purposes. The TAVS data is required to properly record the obligation of funds, to accurately calculate and accomplish reimbursement of the traveler and/or payment to the travel card vendor and to liquidate the obligation when payment is made., The data will be used, processed, and then stored. Data will be stored for six years three months; this is specified by NARA and in the vendor’s contract. NARA guidelines regarding records disposition are to be followed. As specified in the contract, “ETS2 shall prevent the purging of historical records prior to the proper retention period, and permit purging only of those records authorized for disposal by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) per 36 CFR 1228 and 1234. NARA General Records Schedule 9 for Travel and Transportation Records and General Records Schedule 20 for Electronic Records shall apply. The contract stipulates “ETS2 should provide online access to detailed transaction information for a minimum period of 36 months, and permit access to archived detailed transaction information for a period of 6 years and 3 months.” The TAVS data is maintained in accordance with the General Records Retention Schedules issued by the National Archives and Records Administration. Traveler profile data may be updated by the traveler, the TMC, or the System Administrator as needed. The profile is maintained as long as the individual travels, or may travel, at Government expense. The GDS and PNR hold post-travel data for reporting purposes for 90 days, The “Routine uses of records…” section in System of Records, Contracted Travel Services Program: GSA/GOVT-4 states: Information in the system may be disclosed as a routine use as follows: Privacy Impact Assessment CWTSatoTravel, E2 Solutions Page 15 Version 01/11//2018 a.
