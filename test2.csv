At a minimum NARA requires retention for at least 6 years after contracts expire for financial management records.,Data is shared between this system and Pegasys. It is a two-way interface, but personal data is only shared from Pegasys to AFA. AFA does not provide updates of the personal data back to Pegasys. Pegasys has moved to USDA and AFA shares data between the two systems.,GSA/PPFM-11,
2,PIA,Beta.SAM.gov,https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/BetaSAM%20PIA%20.pdf,In the Entity Management functional area, SAM contains records that capture information users voluntarily provide about their entity as part of the process to register to do business with the Federal Government, including the entity legal business name, entity email address, entity telephone number, entity Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and entity address. In the case of a sole proprietor, tax laws allow them to use their Social Security Number (SSN) as their TIN if they do not have a separate Employer Identification Number (EIN). The TIN (whether it be an EIN or an SSN) is not publicly available data. In the exclusion portion of the Performance Information functional area, SAM contains records entered by Federal agency suspension and debarment officials, some of which may be records on individuals.,GSA has established a system of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended), 5 U.S.C. 552a. The System for Award Management (SAM) consolidates functions that were previously handled by the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system, Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).,System records are retained and disposed of according to GSA records maintenance and disposition schedules, the requirements of the Recovery Board, and the National Archives and Records Administration. For the Entity Management functional area, SAM allows users to update and delete their own entity registration records. For the exclusions portion of the Performance Information functional area, electronic records of past exclusions are maintained permanently in the archive list for historical reference. Federal agencies reporting exclusion information in SAM should follow their agency’s guidance and policies for disposition of paper records.,Yes. Federal agency Contract Writing Systems (CWS), grants management systems, and financial systems will all use data from Beta.SAM. They go through a data access request process to allow them certain levels of data. The data is provided over encrypted connections and are either FTP or web services (XML). Part of the access process includes a Non-Disclosure Agreement and System Authorization Access Request which is agreed to by the requestor during the data access request process and includes user responsibility regarding the data.,N/A,

CWTSatoTravel,https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/E2-Solutions%20TAVS%20PIA%20webversion%20signed%20January%2011,%202018.pdf,To use E2 Solutions, a traveler must enter unique identifying information such as user id and password. A user profile is established for each traveler which contains personal information, including organization address, telephone number, travel preferences, frequent flyer and rental car club account numbers, passport information, emergency contract name, alternative address and telephone number, personal credit card number (official travel charge care account at a minimum), date of birth, gender, redress number, known traveler number, and other information as required by the agency’s Travel Authorization and Voucher System , Travel Management Center (TMC), and transportation providers for making reservations and issuing tickets. Information gathered includes Traveler Profile data, Name, SSN (if applicable by agency requirements), UserID, home address, home and office email, home and office telephone numbers, current passport and/or visa number(s), credit card numbers and related information; bank account information needed for electronic funds transfer; frequent traveler account information; travel claim information; destinations; date of birth; gender; redress number; known traveler number; and individual charges and balances. In addition, other passport information (i.e. issuing country, expiration date), and emergency contact information are included. Additional information may be entered at the traveler’s discretion for enhanced service, such as air, hotel, and car rental preferences, and frequent traveler or club membership numbers. When travel arrangements are made, the following information is entered: travel dates and times, departure and arrival cities and airports or terminals, selected airline flight or train tickets Privacy Impact Assessment CWTSatoTravel, E2 Solutions Page 6 Version 01/11//2018 reserved, hotel reservations, and car rentals reserved. Any special requests or accommodations required are also entered. Federal agency accounting systems will interface with the E2 Solutions component for proper recording of obligations when travel authorizations are approved, and for recording expenses when voucher payments are made. (Data will be passed between systems. The agency accounting systems will not have direct access to E2 Solutions databases.) The Travel Management Center (TMC) will have access to the profile and reservation data input by the traveler. This access is necessary for the TMC to complete reservation and ticketing actions (e.g. in order to email the traveler her itinerary). The TMC does not have access to E2 Solutions.. The on-line booking engine directs reservations to the TMC for fulfillment, i.e., ticketing for transportation and confirmation of hotel and/or car reservations. The reservation systems, or Global Distribution Systems (GDS), provide the link between the on-line booking engine and the TMC. GDSX, the interface between the GDS and E2 Solutions provides updates to the traveler’s reservations if modifications are made. This is an interface which data securely traverses between E2 Solutions and the GDS to maintain the integrity of the travelers’ reservations.,Collection of PII is required for E2 Solutions application in support of the ETS2 master contract. The individual traveler’s profile data is needed to accurately reserve and ticket travel, and to have expenses charged to the proper travel charge card account. The reservation data is needed to accomplish the required travel, and to estimate trip costs for authorization purposes. The TAVS data is required to properly record the obligation of funds, to accurately calculate and accomplish reimbursement of the traveler and/or payment to the travel card vendor and to liquidate the obligation when payment is made.,The data will be used, processed, and then stored. Data will be stored for six years three months; this is specified by NARA and in the vendor’s contract. NARA guidelines regarding records disposition are to be followed. As specified in the contract, “ETS2 shall prevent the purging of historical records prior to the proper retention period, and permit purging only of those records authorized for disposal by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) per 36 CFR 1228 and 1234. NARA General Records Schedule 9 for Travel and Transportation Records and General Records Schedule 20 for Electronic Records shall apply. The contract stipulates “ETS2 should provide online access to detailed transaction information for a minimum period of 36 months, and permit access to archived detailed transaction information for a period of 6 years and 3 months.” The TAVS data is maintained in accordance with the General Records Retention Schedules issued by the National Archives and Records Administration. Traveler profile data may be updated by the traveler, the TMC, or the System Administrator as needed. The profile is maintained as long as the individual travels, or may travel, at Government expense. The GDS and PNR hold post-travel data for reporting purposes for 90 days,The “Routine uses of records…” section in System of Records, Contracted Travel Services Program: GSA/GOVT-4 states: Information in the system may be disclosed as a routine use as follows: Privacy Impact Assessment CWTSatoTravel, E2 Solutions Page 15 Version 01/11//2018 a.

This Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is generally the most sensitive information included in the system. Other information includes payroll, accounting, pay and leave entitlement records, payroll deduction and withholding, and time and attendance records.
 

 There are four tiers of users, as categorized by PII access. “Tier one” users are employees that can access their own personal data only, for example personal contact information, benefit election information and time and attendance records. Examples of “tier two” users are an employee’s supervisor who has access to information including that employee’s home address, personal contact information, and time and attendance records but specifically excluding Social Security Number (SSN) and date of birth (DOB). “Tier three” users are comprised of a subset of GSA OHRM staff users who may have a need to access employees’ SSNs or DOBs, as well as the information available at tiers one and two. “Tier four” users are a different subset of GSA OHRM staff who may need access to voluntarily reported employee data including race and national origin to evaluate how GSA is meeting its policies and practices on hiring and retaining minorities, women, and disabled persons, analyzing their status in the workforce; and for establishing workforce diversity goals and timetables.
 

 HR Links receives information about GSA employees from the systems listed below:
 Payroll, Accounting and Reporting (PAR) system –PAR is GSA’s payroll processing system and the link between the GSA’s HR and accounting systems. HR Links sends updated personnel data to the payroll system along with the time and attendance information required to perform payroll actions. GSA’s payroll system provides HR Links with the resulting payroll information after each payroll processing cycle. GSA employee PII shared from PAR to HR Links and from HR Links to PAR includes the employee’s name, date of birth, and social security number. However, HR Links and PAR do not exchange employee home addresses, or phone numbers.
 

 GSA Credential and Identity Management System (GCIMS) - GCIMS contains credential and background investigation information for all GSA employees and contractors. HR Links has a bidirectional connection to GCIMS and shares PII including SSN as part of the background investigation process.
 

 GSA JOBS - GSA JOBS contains information on GSA positions. HR Links has a bidirectional connection to GSA JOBS to track which positions are open or being filled.
 

 HR Links transmits information to the systems listed below via secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) which provides the ability to push data to external sources through batch file transfer.
 

 The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Federal Occupational Health (FOH) – HHS’ FOH provides a benefit to all federal agencies for work-life balance activities for Federal employees (https://www.worklife4you.com/index.html) .

GSA employee data is retained for a minimum of seven years, per NARA chapter 3 guidance, but may be retained longer for example in cases of court order, pursuant to open litigation. Final disposal of data is in accordance with GSA’s disposal policy.
 

 HR Links complies with all GSA retention and disposal procedures specified by 1820.1 CIO P GSA Records Maintenance and Disposition System. Records contained in the HR Links system will be retained consistent with section 2.2 of NARA General Records Schedule, “Employee Management Records”. See https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/grs/trs29-sch-only.pdf,HR Links receives information about GSA employees from the systems listed below:
 Payroll, Accounting and Reporting (PAR) system –PAR is GSA’s payroll processing system and the link between the GSA’s HR and accounting systems. HR Links sends updated personnel data to the payroll system along with the time and attendance information required to perform payroll actions. GSA’s payroll system provides HR Links with the resulting payroll information after each payroll processing cycle. GSA employee PII shared from PAR to HR Links and from HR Links to PAR includes the employee’s name, date of birth, and social security number. However, HR Links and PAR do not exchange employee home addresses, or phone numbers.
 

 GSA Credential and Identity Management System (GCIMS) - GCIMS contains credential and background investigation information for all GSA employees and contractors. HR Links has a bidirectional connection to GCIMS and shares PII including SSN as part of the background investigation process.
 

 GSA JOBS - GSA JOBS contains information on GSA positions. HR Links has a bidirectional connection to GSA JOBS to track which positions are open or being filled.
 

 HR Links transmits information to the systems listed below via secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) which provides the ability to push data to external sources through batch file transfer.
 

 The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Federal Occupational Health (FOH) – HHS’ FOH provides a benefit to all federal agencies for work-life balance activities for Federal employees (https://www.worklife4you.com/index.html) . This FOH-managed program requires that each Federal agency provide a list of current employees to the WorkLife4You vendor. HR Links provides a full list of GSA employees to FOH on a monthly basis including name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, and home address to allow FOH to offer benefits.

31,PIA,ImageNow,https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/ImageNow_AFA_PIA.pdf,The following personal information is required for the administration of the Child Subsidy program:
 

 ● employee by name or other unique identifier
 ● gender,
 ● birth date,
 ● age,
 ● marital status,
 ● spouse and
 ● dependents,
 ● home e-mail address,
 ● home address,
 ● home phone number,
 ● cell phone number,
 ● work phone number,
 ● health records,
 ● Social Security Number (SSN), (only captured in the image, not in the database)
 ● Employer Identification Number,
 ● payroll deductions,
 ● banking information,
 ● personal credit card information,
 

 The SSN is used for tax identification purposes in the Child Subsidy program and relates to the payroll processing. This is stored in the PAR system database, and only in ImageNow as part of an image.
 

 For invoice capture, items such as a person’s name, banking information, credit card information, and a SSN are captured only when a vendor is a sole-proprietorship using their personal information for business purposes. The SSN may be included in the image, but is not captured in the database. 
 When invoices are related to a company that is not a sole proprietorship, these entries relate to business points of contact, business addresses, and business banking information, none of which is subject to the Privacy Act, because corporations and organizations do not have any Privacy Act rights. In both cases, the data is captured or searching the invoices and relating the data to data in Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable modules in Pegasys.,ImageNow has two primary purposes:
 1. Archival of images for paper and electronic documents to eliminate the need to manage paper file cabinets or external file structures.
 2. Categorization of the documents as they relate to the systems that manage the business processes such as the payroll system and financial management system.,As an archival system that must be available for research of past transactions and as such the data must be retained to support the data retention requirements of the systems using the data. GSA at this time does not archive any of the ImageNow data and all data is being retained. If this changes in the future, this document will be updated.,ImageNow only shares the images (documents) it stores with external parties to include the USDA Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable users. Internal sharing also occurs, but the sharing with the financial system hosted at USDA is the only external sharing that occurs. The Pegasys and ImageNow database synchronization routine ensures that documents in ImageNow can be referenced by their related transactions in Pegasys, the financial system. Users of Pegasys can display and see the documents during processing of financial transactions and in response to later inquiries. The Pegasys system allows the documents to be pulled and viewed by Pegasys users who are both within GSA and external to GSA.,GSA/PPFM-12,

 login.gov manages user authentication by allowing users to sign in with an email address, password, multi-factor method, and “identity proofing” by verifying an individual's asserted identity on behalf of partner agencies. User authentication is the process of establishing confidence in user identities electronically presented to an information system. Identity proofing is the process of verifying that a person is who they say they are. PII must be collected from a login.gov user to identity proof that user at an Identity Assurance Level (IAL) required by a partner agency to grant access to its information, applications, programs, or records (for the purpose of this PIA, ‘‘services''). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines IAL as “a category that conveys the degree of confidence that the applicant’s claimed identity is their real identity.”5
 

 Identity assurance levels categorize “the degree of confidence that the applicant’s claimed identity is their real identity.”6 login.gov operates at two levels of identity assurance, IAL1 and IAL2. A user will only be asked for information necessary to achieve the IAL required by the partner agency to access a given service. IAL1 provides a partner agency very limited assurance that the same individual who created the login.gov account is, in fact, accessing that partner agency’s service or information.7 This PIA analyzes how login.gov works at both IAL levels; how login.gov manages information as a strategic resource;8 incorporates NIST's definitions of privacy risk; and describes how login.gov mitigates such risks.9,System records will be disposed of in accordance with NARA’s General Records Schedule (GRS) Transmittal 29, section 3.2 “System access records,” which covers user profiles, log-in files, password files, audit trail files and extracts, system usage files, and cost-back files used to assess charges to partner agencies for usage of login.gov.,With the user's consent, the user's email address and agency UUID will be shared with a partner agency. If the partner agency requires identity proofing information for users authenticating via login.gov, then those users’ self-asserted PII, including name, address, social security number, birth date and/or contact phone number could also be transmitted pursuant to the user’s consent and the agreement between login.gov and the partner agency. That information is encrypted during transit using Transport Layer Security over Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (TLS over HTTPS) and inside either a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or OpenID Connect (OIDC) signed payload. The user's phone number for calls or text messages from the third-party multi-factor authentication service provider and additional information required for IAL23 identity proofing are also encrypted using TLS over HTTPS during transmission.,GSA/TTS-1,
33,PIA,NBC Studley,https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/NBC%20Studley%20_PIA_March2019.pdf,The NBC Studley system will include the following types of PII:
 

 ● Contact Information
 ● Business Information
 ● Financial Information
 ● Social Security Numbers
 

 The Studley broker agents collects information to form leasing packages for the GSA acting as agents of GSA. Within those packages there are the following data requirements which if the lessor would need to provide when enacting a lease with GSA through the Studley brokers. The following information is required if business information is not available:
 Lessor Name, Lessor Address, Lessor Phone Number, Lessor Email Address (business or personal as applicable), Lessor Tax ID (if not a business this is their SSN), Financial Account Information (bank account information).,GSA maintains information required throughout the lifecycle of a PBS building lease including information about leases, offerors, and lessors. In addition to business contact and identification information (address, telephone number, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)), the system includes personal information on individuals who use personal contact and identification information (home address, telephone, e-mail, and fax numbers, and Social Security Number) for business purposes as sole proprietors. The authority to maintain such the information comes from the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. Sec. 585). The purpose is to establish and maintain a system for operating, controlling, and managing the Federal property leasing program; tracking leasing projects and workflow activities; and managing associated documents.
 

 System information may be accessed and used by authorized GSA employees and contractors to conduct official duties associated with Federal government building leases. Information from this system may be disclosed as a routine use as described in the eLEASE SORN, but as a general matter, the information collected from potential lessors is only staged for upload.,The NBC Studley system does not have a records retention schedule as final documents and records are uploaded into GREX. Project records are maintained in electronic project folders until the project is closed out after occupancy. Prior to closeout by the Government, the Broker confirms that all records have been transferred. Any documentation that is not provided by an offeror, but not specifically requested is uploaded into G-REX as supplemental documentation.
 Disposition of GREX records will be according to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) guidelines, set forth in the GSA Records Maintenance and Disposition System (OAD P 1820.2A) handbook.,Information is not shared outside of GSA.,GSA/PBS-5,

The OCR Complaint Management System is also used to collect EEOC data reporting requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations governing federal Sector EEO Complaint processing (29 CFR parts 1614) and the Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 (No FEAR Act).,Yes. Specific to EEO complaint records, NARA has established standards for records retention under File #332. The Agency will remove and place cases in inactive files after resolution of the EEO case. There will be a cut off of inactive files annually. GSA will destroy case files 4 years after cutoff (GRS1, item 25a).,If a hearing or appeal is requested, the Office of General Counsel is provided with the report of investigation and complaint file, as they defend the agency in EEO matters. Settlement agreements are shared with the Office of Human Resources Management for processing. The agency director is aware of settlement agreements and high profile cases. Management officials and witness become aware of pending investigations in which their testimony is required. The information is also shared with Heads of Service and Staff Offices (HSSOs), complainants and their representatives.,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/1996/11/26/96-30071/privacy-act-of-1974-systemof-records,

The system also contains data needed to perform detailed accounting distributions and provide for tasks such as mailing checks and bonds and preparing and mailing tax returns and reports. Collection of SSNs is required by the Department of Treasury and IRS policy, rules and/or regulations,The PAR system provides complete functionality for an employee’s entire service life from initial hire through final payment and submission of retirement records to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).,The GSA has a NARA-approved records retention schedule. The PAR financial data is retained for 6 years 3 months as required by NARA. An employee's historical records are maintained in the PAR database for 18 months after separation and are then purged from the database.,The PAR outputs that GSA uses are comprehensive payroll reports; accounting distribution of costs; leave data summary reports; each employee's statement of earnings, deductions, and leave every payday; State, city, and local unemployment compensation reports; Federal, State, and local tax reports; 
 

 Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement; and reports of withholding and contributions.
 

 For the Office of Human Resources Services, outputs include data for reports of Federal civilian employment. The system also provides data to GSA staff and administrative offices to use for management purposes.
 

 The employee's name, SSN, date of birth, and home address are reported to SERCO on behalf of the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) which invests the employee's TSP, mails statements to the employee, and provides TSP loans. 
 

 The employee's name, SSN, and address are sent to IRS for tax payments, to meet Affordable Care Act requirements, and W-2 data reporting.
 

 The employee's name, SSN, and address are sent to SSA for tax information reporting.
 

 The employee's name, SSN, and date of birth are sent to OPM with the retirement data upon separation.
 

 The employee's name, SSN, home address, and banking information are sent to OPM's Employee Express so the employee can retrieve their own pay and leave data, W-2s, and make changes to their home address and banking information.
 

 The employee's name, SSN, and address are sent to the taxing authorities for State and local entities.
 PII data is also sent to the following agencies/companies, on an as-needed basis and in accordance with the “routine uses” provided for in the PAR SORN, GSA/PPFM-9​:
  
 ● American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) receives union dues files for union members only.
 ● Bureau of Public Debt (BPD) receives client payroll accounting files, for example lists of employees with a debt.
 ● Department of Labor (DOL) receives child support payments and continuation of pay statement (workmen’s compensation).
 ● Health Benefits Insurance Carriers (e.g. BlueCross/BlueShield, Aetna, HMOs) receive health insurance premiums.
 ● National Business Center, Department Of Interior (DOI) receives aggregated accounting files.
 ● National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) receives agency accounting files and 401k data.
 ● Office of Personnel Management (OPM) receives employee retirement information, health insurance information, life insurance information, agency accounting files, and labor distribution data.
 ● Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) receives agency accounting files, labor distribution data, and transit benefit data.
 ● TALX Corporation receives unemployment and employment verification information.
 ● Treasury Department receives payment files with banking information and treasury salary offset program file (debt collection).
 ● United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) receives certain agencies’ client payroll accounting files and health benefits information.
 ● Veterans Administration (VA) receives an Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA) extract file.
 ● Wells Fargo receives National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) 401k data.
 All data sent outside GSA is sent via secure FTP, agency/company secure portals, specific IP authentications, Connect Direct, by logging into an agency's server via Putty, STS, ESB, or an encrypted password protected email attachment.
 For the Payroll RPA, it will use a "file distribution list" that contains all of the files to be distributed to the customer POCs. Each line on the "file distribution list" contains the file name, the adjustments required to the file, the POCs for the distribution, their email addresses, and whether the file needs to be encrypted. Encryption is determined based on a flag within the "file distribution list." Files flagged for encryption are encrypted and password protected. The encryption flag is based on PII and/or who is getting sent the file. If it has PII and being sent outside of GSA, then it is encrypted. The encryption flag is determined by the Payroll Team. The bot can only pull contacts off of one line at a time and after each line is completed, the variables are cleared, so that should mitigate any risk of sending files to incorrect contacts.,SA/PPFM-9,
36,PIA,Real Estate Taxes Portal (RET),https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/Real%20Estate%20Taxes%20Portal%20(RET)%20PIA.pdf,The application collects tax documentation and data from External GSA Lessors who hold a GSA lease. Data that is collected is associated with each document upload/submission (tax year, block and lot number, tax bill frequency, tax period start and end date, municipality). Information contained in submitted tax documents varies by municipality and by ownership entity; documents could contain Names, Addresses, Tax ID Numbers (which may be SSN for small business owners), Business or Home Addresses of Property Owners, Phone Numbers and other personally identifiable information.
 All accounts must register first; lessors must provide an email address, name and region.,The information collected in the RET Portal is used solely to process Real Estate Tax Adjustments pursuant to GSA Lease terms with External Lessors. This documentation is collected to ensure proper accurate and timely payment of property taxes. Data collected is related to the document uploads made each year for a lease for easy identification purposes in the G-REX Application. Submission dates, tax years and associated system data will be used to effectively manage the efficiency of the Lease Contract Administration program (analyze processing time, utilization).,Records are ultimately stored within the G-REX system as the RET app is not a system of record. The RET app will retain submitted data and documents so as to provide a record for the submitters of information. The data is retained in RET as external lessors will need and desire to see their past submissions against their contracts, as well as submissions in “draft” but not yet submitted. Once a lease ends, related documents are declared as records, and put on a "hold" status for 8 fiscal years.,No,GSA/PBS-5,

Applicants are required to submit certain required information in order to be considered for job candidacy. Relevant PII data is collected to provide hiring stakeholders information on applicants that allows them to remain in contact when applicable job announcements are posted.
 

 1. The application owner will have the ability to easily import a list of new applicants and jobs data in comma separated value (.csv) format into the TTS applicant tracker application (via the Salesforce Data Import Wizard)
 a. Support all new job applicants as they begin the process
 2. TTS Hiring Managers are easily able to see the hiring status for the various job postings, and the status associated to subsequent applicants
 3. TTS Hiring Personnel are easily able to collaborate and rate applicants for job postings in a centralized location
  a. TTS Hiring Personnel can be assigned to fill a role (phone screen, interview, SME) for a particular job posting or for a group of job applicants
  b. A systematic workflow is in place which requires the input from various hiring personnel in order to move an applicant through the hiring process
 4. Veterans preference can be assigned to applicants who have veteran status.
  a. Visibility of an applicant's veteran status will only be visible to individuals with a need to know
  b. When Jobs have Applications with Veteran’s Preference, these applications must be dispositioned prior to any Applications without a Veteran’s Preference.,Applicant records will be maintained in accordance with General Records Schedule 2.1, Item 50 which specifies a two year retention policy. For example, any applicant who has not applied to a TTS position during the previous two fiscal year periods will be subject to a removal of records. This removal of records process will occur in tandem with each fiscal year change. However, the system will allow the flexibility for the Application Owner to request that entire records are deleted by a Salesforce administrator, or that a subset of certain fields within the applicant’s records are deleted by a Salesforce administrator.,Data is generally not shared with any other agencies, applications or systems. Dashboard reporting is contained within the Salesforce ORG, and is not shared outside of the ORG or with any other applications, agencies or systems. However, with the applicant’s permission, TTS recruiters may refer an applicant to State and local governments, congressional offices, international organizations, and other public offices for employment consideration.,OPM-GOVT-5,
43,PIA,TTS Data.gov,https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/20200114%20-%20DATAgov_PIAdocx%20(1).pdf,Data.gov collects names and email addresses of those users who choose to input that information. The input of names and email addresses from users is optional.,GSA collects names and email addresses when users choose to leave comments or ask questions about a particular dataset. This information is retained in order to provide a direct response to the user from Data.gov or the agency responsible for the dataset in question.,A records retention schedule is not required for the datasets collected in the Data.gov application. Data.gov is not an official recordkeeping place for contributing agencies. Each agency gives a non-record copy of the dataset to Data.Gov and is responsible for managing their own dataset according to their own agency's schedule. GSA does not manage other agency's records as a proxy. These public-facing datasets are not considered "records," but reference copies.
 

 Names and email addresses of public users who ask a question of data.gov staff are stored within GSA’s email system and covered by the General Records Schedule for Public Customer Service Records (GRS 06.5/010; DAA-GRS-2017-0002-0001). This schedule covers records an agency creates or receives while providing customer service to the public. Federal agencies that provide direct services to the public operate customer call centers or service centers to assist external customers. They may provide customer support through telephone discussions (tollfree numbers), dialogue (via chat), and email.,Because Data.gov is a central catalog, users make comments and requests that need to be properly addressed by the agencies that own a particular dataset. User are not required to provide names or email addresses in order to submit feedback. Data.gov forwards all comments/requests to the agency’s open data lead for action. If the user provides a name and email address, Data.gov will share this information with the open data lead and at that point, the responsibility for responding to the user belongs to the agency that owns the relevant dataset. The Data.gov feedback system (Data.gov Help Desk) is designed to allow agency points of contact to access the feedback items for that agency only via OMB Max authentication.,N/A,
44,PIA,USAccess,https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/USAccess_PIA_March2019.pdf,The personal information collected in the enrollment process consists of data elements necessary to verify the identity of individuals and to perform background investigations concerning applicants. The data elements retained by the USACCESS IDMS for the PIV Card applicants include: name, date of birth, SSN, organizational and employee affiliations, fingerprints, digital color photograph, work e-mail address, and phone number(s), as well as additional verification and demographic information. Other types of data contained in the system may include: military status; foreign national status, federal emergency response official status; law enforcement official status; results of background check; and PIV Card issuance location.,The primary purposes of the system are: To issue high assurance identity credentials, in accordance with federal standards, enabling federal agencies to ensure the safety and security of Federal facilities, systems, or information, and of facility occupants and users; to provide for interoperability and trust in allowing physical access to individuals entering Federal facilities; and to allow logical access to Federal information systems, networks, and resources on a government-wide basis.
 The PII collected is necessary for fulfilling this purpose as it is required to accurately identify the individual for whom a PIV card and digital identity certificates are issued. Data elements (e.g. SSN’s and other identifiers) are collected for the purpose of uniquely identifying applicants within the population of federal employees and contractors to locate their enrollment, sponsorship, and card activation records. Other information (e.g. biometrics and physical characteristics) are stored on PIV cards, in accordance with federal PIV standards.,The active life expectancy of the data in the HSPD-12 USACCESS IDMS/ Card Management System (CMS) is for the duration of the active identity account, which could be for the duration of the individual's employment/assignment (for contractors) for shared service participating agencies.
 The GSA Records Retention Officer and the Department of Homeland Security developed the “GSA Personal Identity Verification IDMS Record Retention and Disposition Schedule” document for data retention schedules. As indicated, the retention requirements are a minimum of five years from the date when the identity account moves from an active to inactive status (month of separation).
 Disposition of records will be according to NARA disposition authority N1-269-06-1 (pending).,No. Participating Federal agencies will only have access to their own particular agency’s data (not to any other agency’s data).
 The exception is disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. Section 552a(b) of the Privacy Act. All or a portion of the records or information contained in this system may be disclosed outside GSA as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as follows:

In the Entity Management functional area, SAM contains records that capture information users voluntarily provide about their entity as part of the process to register to do business with the Federal Government, including the entity legal business name, entity email address, entity telephone number, entity Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and entity address. In the case of a sole proprietor, tax laws allow them to use their Social Security Number (SSN) as their TIN if they do not have a separate Employer Identification Number (EIN). The TIN (whether it be an EIN or an SSN) is not publicly available data. In the exclusion portion of the Performance Information functional area, SAM contains records entered by Federal agency suspension and debarment officials, some of which may be records on individuals. Exclusion records on individuals contain certain information that will never be displayed publicly, e.g. street address information, as well as the SSN or TIN. Agencies disclose the SSN of an individual to verify the identity of an individual, only if permitted under the Privacy Act of 1974 and, if appropriate, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, as codified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a).,GSA proposes to establish a new system of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended), 5 U.S.C. 552a. The System for Award Management (SAM) consolidates functions that were previously handled by the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system, Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). SAM provides the capability to manage information about entities wishing to do business with the Federal Government, and maintain information about those entities to ensure that entities seeking to do business with the Federal Government have not been debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from doing business. SAM maintains this Governmentwide system of records to enable Federal agencies to determine who is registered to do business with the Federal Government, and to identify individuals who have been excluded from participating in Federal procurement and non-procurement (financial or non-financial assistance and benefits programs), throughout the Federal Government. In some instances a record may demonstrate that an exclusion applies only to the agency taking the action, and therefore does not have Governmentwide effect. The purpose of these exclusions is to protect the Government from non-responsible contractors and individuals, ensure proper management throughout the Federal government, and protect the integrity of Federal activities.,System records are retained and disposed of according to GSA records maintenance and disposition schedules, the requirements of the Recovery Board, and the National Archives and Records Administration. For the Entity Management functional area, SAM allows users to update and delete their own entity registration records. For the exclusions portion of the Performance Information functional area, electronic records of past exclusions are maintained permanently in the archive list for historical reference. Federal agencies reporting exclusion information in SAM should follow their agency's guidance and policies for disposition of paper records.,,,
